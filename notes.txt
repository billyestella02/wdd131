Web Forms Design Best Practices

3. Only include what is necessary
4. Clearly identify required fields
5. Place labels above and left aligned 
6. Never use multiple columns in the form
7. Use Radio buttons for less than 5 options. Use Dropdown for more than 5 options
8. Use single input for the phone number
9. Use placeholders to avoid confusion. Do not use placeholders to replace labels
10. Order choices logically
11. Wrap all inputs in labels
12. Never add a reset button to the page
13. Show a confirmation page
14. Beautiful design makes the user trust the form
